![App Screen Shot](/readmescreenshot/screenshot.png)

Insta Search allows users to search for pictures by a hashtag and ranging between certain dates. Insta Search uses the Instagram API to query for results and shows the results to the user on the same page.

To run the app locally, please clone my repository. Use requirements.txt to set up an environment and source the secrets (these are not on github so I would have to provide them to you). Then run "python server.py" in the command line.
